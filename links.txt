ISO 216 specifies international standard (ISO) paper sizes used in most
countries in the world today, with the United States and Canada the main
exceptions.  The standard defines the "A" and "B" series of paper sizes,
including A4, the most commonly available size.  Two supplementary standards,
ISO 217 and ISO 269, define related paper sizes; the ISO 269 "C" series is
commonly listed alongside the A and B sizes.
A4 210mm x 297mm

Joining two pdfs with slightly different page size with pdfjoin
under Linux or Mac
pdfjoin --paper a4paper --rotateoversize false
  does the trick for me. rotateoversize is the important option
pdfjam --paper a4paper file1.pdf file2.pdf
  did the trick for me using one letter-sized document and one
  slightly-not-A4-document, they're both joined as A4 as expected.

PDFjam is a small collection of shell scripts that provide a simple interface to some of the
functionality of the pdfpages package for pdfLaTeX.  Facilities include n-up imposition, page
rotation, reflection and trimming, selection of pages, and many more.  PDFjam depends on a working
installation of (pdf)LaTeX, complete with the pdfpages package.  For Mac OS X, some example
applications (droplets) are provided for drag-and-drop access.

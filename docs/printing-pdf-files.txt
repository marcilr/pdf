Printing PDF files


Adobe has released an Acrobat reader for Linux, and it's
available on the Adobe home page http://www.adobe.com.
Its predecessor, xpdf, is also available.  Both should
print to a postscript device.

Any good alternatives to Adobe Acrobat reader which
I question if it is still available for the penguin.

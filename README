pdftotext
  pdftotext (PDF to text converter)
  pdftotext is an open source command-line utility for converting PDF files
  to plain text files -i.e. extracting text data from PDF-encapsulated files.
  It is freely available and included by default with many Linux distributions,
  and is also available for Windows as part of the Xpdf Windows port.  Such
  text extraction is complicated as PDF files are internally built on page
  drawing primitives, meaning the boundaries between words and paragraphs
  often must be inferred based on their position on the page.

  Using gimp to split images.  Used when refacting the scanned Ben Bridges 2012 watch catalog.

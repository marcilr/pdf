PPI - Pixels per inch (PPI) or pixel density is a measurement of the resolution of devices in
  various contexts: typically computer displays, image scanners, and digital camera image sensors.
  ...
  It has become commonplace to refer to PPI as DPI, which is incorrect because PPI always refers
  to input resolution.  Good quality photographs usually require 300 pixels per inch, at 100% size,
  when printed onto coated paper stock, using a printing screen of 150 lines per inch (lpi).  This
  delivers a quality factor of 2, which delivers optimum quality.  The lowest acceptable quality
  factor is considered to be 1.5, which equates to printing a 175ppi image using a 150 lpi screen
  onto coated paper.
